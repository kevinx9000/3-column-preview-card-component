## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I started with a desktop-first workflow because I'm typically more comfortable with that, but then switching to create a media query for a mobile layout became an absolute nightmare where I almost gave up. Then I started over with a mobile-first workflow, and based on the previous work I had done, it was a breeze. First time for me that I've used mobile-first and it was actually easier.
